## General info
<p align="justify">
As one of the assessment methods, the Programming Techniques discipline proposes the development of software, in the format of a platform game, with the objective of learning software engineering techniques, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming in the C++ language , this project also provides a small simulation of what it would be like to develop software for companies, with weekly meetings, goals to be achieved and distribution of work in the team, in addition to learning about extra tools such as version control of models and codes, and graphic libraries. For this, in this work, the game “Knight Journey” was made, in which the player faces three different types of enemies in a medieval setting. The game is separated into two phases, each with its own difficulty and visual representation. To carry out the project, the standard requirements on the discipline's website were considered, with the outline elaboration with its modeling via Class Diagram in Unified Modeling Language (“Unified Modeling Language” - UML) based on a general diagram and previous standard. Made in C++ programming language, for its development, the game included a variety of object-oriented programming techniques, allowing several of the proposed requirements to be successfully accomplished.
